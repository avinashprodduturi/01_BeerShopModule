# BeerShopModule

## Beer Shop Module in MAVEN/ JUNIT/ REST/ HIBERNATE/ ANGULAR/ JENKINS

This project is a refresher to create basic REST Services which performs basic CRUD operations.
1. Maven is used to pull all the dependencies - Refer POM.xml
1. We have JUNIT Folders to implement JUnit Assertions as part of Unit Test. Our Maven Goal is **TEST**
1. We are using JERSEY API to implement RESTful Services
1. We will be talking to SQL DB and Using Hibernate annotations and HQL to perform CRUD Operations
1. Finally we will build and Angular.js page and consume the REST Services.
1. For continuous Integration, we will also work on Jenkins. I would include these details in ReadMe file eventually.

Overall Goal of this project is have a basic complete WEB Project and start using GIT branches to enhance this over time with standard Factory patterns, Complex Collections usage and eventually newer version of Java bits.

Feel free to contribute and collaborate here.
